    "<p>In this section, we are going to look at the statistical measures from the perspective of linear algebra and geometry. Our goal is to investigate random variables and their relationships through correlation and variance analysis. We will build our content on the vector spaces and the dot product. We will put a special emphasis on considering various definitions of the concepts because they will shape our intuition.</p>\n",

    "<p>In this case, we can observe that as the distance between the vectors decreases the value of the dot product increases and vice versa. So, we can interpret the dot product as an operation that rewards the similarity which increases when the two vectors get closer.</p>\n",

Observe that if we rotate the \\(x-y\\) axis, their basis vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{i}, \\overrightarrow{j}\\) won't change as they point toward the positive direction of their respective axis. So, for example, we can choose a basis  whose unit vectors on the direction of \\(\\overrightarrow{b}\\) and calculate the dot product as follows:</p>\n",

Relationship in this context is not a cause-and-effect type of relationship, but how a change in one parameter is accompanied by the other one. It is also important to note that the correlation we consider here is Pearson’s Correlation and it only captures the linear relationship between the parameters. That’s why it is possible to have a zero Pearson correlation between two non-linearly correlated parameters.</p>\n",
    "<p>Suppose we are running a supermarket and know that apple sales will be higher in the spring.

We want to know if there is a relation between apple and lemon sales.</p>\n",
    "<p>Let's think \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) as vectors, \\(X= [x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n ]^T\\)and \\(Y = [y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n ]^T\\), and each components of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are corresponding to the consecutive measurements of two different things that we would like to analyze their relationship.</p>\n",
    "<p>We can expect the values of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) to have different scales. In order to compare \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), we need to scale them by subtracting their mean, element-wise, so that they will be zero-centered. From a geometric point of view, in this mean-centering procedure, we re-position the coordinate system to make the origins coincide with the average point.</p>\n",
    "<p>This scaling will provide us the ability to  compare the parameters with respect to their direction in each dimension. In other words, we can expect components of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) to share the same signs when they behave similarly. These values and how they relate to the relationship between parameters can remind us the cosine function as we are investigating the degree of similarity between two vectors.</p>\n",
